# Course Template

This repository is a template for managing coursework using GitHub pages.  It
uses the theme [dinky](https://github.com/pages-themes/dinky),
[nbviewer.js](https://github.com/kokes/nbviewer.js), and
[reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) for presenting material.


## Instructions to get started

For basic class info, modify: _data/class.yml, _includes/class_info.html and _config.yml

## For each day:

For each week of class, create a subdirectory `dayZZ` (where `ZZ` is the day
of the class) and place any `.ipynb` and `.md` files in that directory.
Lectures can utilize the layout `lecture`, which will present them in revealjs.
