### My background

<!--![](images/intro_naiman1.png =0.1x)-->
<img src="images/intro_naiman1.png" alt="drawing" width="800"/>

notes: so my PhD is in theoretical and computational astrophysics

here is a picture of a simulation I worked on

---

### My background

<img src="images/intro_naiman3.png" alt="drawing" width="800"/>

notes: here I've highlighted a few things - the purple is this stuff called "dark matter" which makes up about 95% of our universe

the orange stuff are concentrations of gas where galaxies form

Don't know what galaxies are?  Don't worry!  We'll go over it later in class

---

### My background

<img src="images/intro_naiman4.png" alt="drawing" width="800"/>

notes: if you looked deep within these centers of gas you'd find galaxies forming

Here are some pictures of "fake" galaxies that this simulation produced

BE AWARE: the basic numerical technqiues used in this large simulation, including how these images are made, are thing we will cover in this very class!

Naiman et al. 2017, Borkiewicz et al. 2018

notes: I've also worked for the past several years with folks at the Advanced Visualization Laboratory at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois

These are computer scientists and visual effects artists that make a lot of scientific documentaries and IMAX shows

Here is an example of how the process of taking a simulation box and making an image works

## Timed activity! (~2 minutes)

Turn to your neighbor and:
1. Introduce yourself - what is your name and where are you from?
1. What is your favorite science topic?

notes: I realize this is a little hokey, but we do really need to get to know eachother!

---

## Timed activity! (~2 minutes)

Turn to your *other* neighbor and:
1. Introduce yourself - what is your name and where are you from?
1. What are you excited to learn about in this class?

## What are we doing?

Essentially:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o2lRpiediP8?start=340" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The data for this movie snippet was simulated using similar numerical methods to what are going to build in this class.

The movie was created in AVL using visualization methods we will make use of in week 2 (our's won't be as polished, but this viz was built by a team of experts!).

notes: essentially, we'll be doing this, more or less

The data for this movie is generated from something called an SPH simulation - SPH stands for smooth particle hydordynamics.  This solves *both* gravitational *and* hydrodynamical (i.e. how gas interacts) forces - we'll just be solving for gravitational forces in this class, specifically this first week.

The data outputs from this simulation are scientific in nature - so things like particle temperature, velocity, location, but translating that into colors and shapes is the job of the visualization expert - we'll start thinking about methods to do just that in the 2nd week of this class.

We'll start off simply but there are ways to extend the complexity of our [planetary models](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/solar-sistem-00c2fd1b0cf74846b540c3c4b95e7f6b).

notes: we'll build to things like this with planetary systems and/or galactic systems that you calculate the motions and shapes for this week

Here I'm just showing similar examples with a (hopefully) familiar planetary system and a galaxy simulation I worked with a little while ago

## What are we doing?

To do this, we need to know the following things:

---

## What are we doing?

To do this, we need to know the following things:
1. Astronomy: 
 * we'll learn a bit about planets, stars, and galaxies
 
notes: From the survey most folks don't have an astronomy background so we'll spend a bit of time learning about that

---

## What are we doing?

To do this, we need to know the following things:
1. Astronomy: 
 * we'll learn a bit about planets, stars, and galaxies
1. Physics: 
 * circular motion, gravity, and how objects move in orbits under the influence of gravity
 * we'll look at the analytical solution for 2-gravitating-body motion
 
notes:

Folks have a variety of physics, math - this is great!
 * we'll go over some aspects of circular motion in general, and 2-body orbits - this will be review for most, but there will be plenty of time to get caught up on homework and you can always ask questions!
 * I'll provide a writeup of the full, calculus-based solutions for kepler's laws of motions - since calculus is not a requirement for this class, we'll just cover some ways to apply kepler's laws to problems. 
   * feel free to re-check up on the calculus solution once you've taken some calculus classes!

 * we'll look at the analytical solution for 2-gravitating-body motion
1. Programming: 
 * the basics - what is programming?  Flow control, functions, calculations and beyond!
 * how to use code to solve for the motion of more than 2 objects in a gravitational system
 * how to use code to translate our scientific simulations into neat visualizations (images, movies, and on the web)
 
notes:

Folks have a variety of coding backgrounds as well - this is also great!
 * we'll go over some basics of coding practices today and tomorrow as well - again, this will be review for some and totally new for others and that is totally fine!

 * Web client, standalone client and mobile devices can access this team.
 * At the end of the course, the team will be discontinued.
 * Please think carefully before direct messaging if you could ask in a public
   forum instead.
 * Conduct will be held to same standards as any educational venue.

notes:
Please use slack as much as you need!  You can use it to share items and
articles with the class, to collaborate, to discuss and ask questions and get
feedback.  However, please do behave in a professional fashion.

 * Day 3: Numerical and analytical solutions of orbits for 2-body problem
 * Day 4: Multi-body problem in 2D

### Data Visualization Week

 * Day 1: Intro to data viz, simple 2D movies
 * Day 2: Visualization concepts overview, 2D & 3D movies
 * Day 3: Graphical concepts, "good" vs. "bad" viz, 3D movies and interactions
 * Day 4: Web-viz, 3D online movies
 * Day 5: Review, finalization of projects, viz party!

notes: this schedule is a little "loose" - i.e. we have some time to go 
into more/less details on things that folks are not into/super interested in

---

## Class outline: Syllabus

### Day structure

First "half":
 * Lecture style covering concepts
 * Physics/Math/Astro practice problems
 * HW discussions
 
Second "half":
 * Hands-on programming
 * Group programming

notes:
Also, we'll in general have morning sessions devoted to physics/math/astro/viz concepts, and this will be more "lecture style"

In the afternoon's we'll do more hands-on coding and group work

See that i've got "half" in quotes - this is because somedays (like today) will be more lecture heavy, while others will be more programming heavy - this will espeically be true as we move later in the week and you're all working on projects

---

## Teaching philosophy

 * Non-competative, group learning environment
 * There are no "lone wolfs" in science - [Path to Newton](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-WSmMd7TJsWeNAZB_wZYeemlLnkRFuHa/view)
   * More info here: https://predictionx.org/path_to_newton
 * Inquiry based approach to learning - basically, we are actually going to do some computational astrophysics!

---

# The Things I Want You To Take Away
1. Coding is not magic, and neither is astrophysics
1. Numerical solutions are only so precise, but we can measure their inaccuracy
1. There are a variety of methods and codes to use for numerical science 
1. There are a variety of systems, tools, and ecosystems available for visualizing data
1. How not to lie with data viz (and how to detect when someone is lying to you!)
1. How to share scientific results online with data viz tools


---

## Assignments

 * Daily, assigned in class, collected following class
 * These will consist of prose, math, reading, and coding assignments
 * There will also be a few online videos with quizzes (on the Canvas webpage)

---

## Plagiarism

 * Plagiarism is about copying ideas.
 * Cite all code you utilize from elsewhere.

notes:
When programming, I expect that you will do things like search on the internet
to find help with a given problem.  This is fine.

But, you *must* cite where any code snippets came from.  And you *must* note if
you are working with other people in the group!

Using snippets of code is fine -- but you may not copy large-scale amounts of
code from other work (for example, other visualizations) and pass it off as
your own.  Always cite, and be reasonable in what you utilize.

---

## Our tools

 * Python
 * Jupyter and Jupyter notebooks (maybe on a Jupyterhub)
 * The occasional usage of a shell such as bash
 * Slack

notes:
You will be expected to write code in Python.  Slack will be used for communications.

We'll also cover a bit of javascript, html for online viz, but that will mostly be "for your interest" and not something you need to dig deep into.



---

## Github (not required, but just FYI)

 * Course repo is at [https://github.com/jnaiman/csci-p-14110](https://jnaiman.github.io/csci-p-14110/)
 * Automatically built to [https://jnaiman.github.io/csci-p-14110/](https://jnaiman.github.io/csci-p-14110/)

notes:
All the materials for this course will be stored in github, and are available
under a very permissive license.  It is largely written in markdown and
automatically compiled to web pages when changes are made.

You are invited to clone the repo, fork and submit changes (typos, etc!), and
to use any information in it in the future.

## Questions:

* Who are you?
* What are we doing?
* How are we going to do it?

---

## Questions:

* ~~Who are you?~~
* ~~What are we doing?~~
* ~~How are we going to do it?~~

notes: so now we've covered all our who what hows! Lets get into the first bit of knowledge that we need - a bit of background about astronomy

---

## Astronomy

The size of stuff:

(Actually not largest star - we know of several more larger!)

notes: so this just gives you a sort of size scale of the things we'll be talking about - we'll be dealing with planets and planetary systems (ours is called the solar system!)
