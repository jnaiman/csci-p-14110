    "There's a subtle but important point to notice here, which is the meaning of the equal sign. In mathematics, the statement that a = b is a statement that two things are equal, and it can be either true or false. In python, as in almost all other programming languages, a = b means something different. It means that the value of the variable a should be changed to whatever value b has. Thus the statement we made a = a + 1 is not an assertion (which is obviously false) that a is equal to itself plus one. It is an instruction to the computer to take the variable a, and 1 to it, and then store the result back into the variable a. In this example, it therefore changes the value of a from 4 to 5.\n",

    "One more point regrading assignments: the fact that = means something different in programming than it does in mathematics implies that the statements a = b and b = a will have very different effects. The first one causes the computer to forget whatever is stored in a and replace it by whatever is stored in b. The second statement has the opposite effect: the computer forgets what is stored in b, and replaces it by whatever is stored in a.\n",

    "A floating point variable is capable of holding real numbers. Why have different types of variables for integers versus non-integer real numbers? In mathematics there is no need to make the distinction, of course: all integers are real numbers, so it would seem that there should be no reason to have a separate type of variable to hold integers. However, this ignores the way computers work. On a computer, operations involving integers are exact: 1 + 1 is exactly 2. However, operations on real numbers are necessarily inexact. I say necessarily because a real number is capable of having an arbitrary number of decimal places. The number pi contains infinitely many digits, and never repeats, but my computer only comes with a finite amount of memory and processor power. Even rational numbers run into this problem, because their decimal representation (or to be exact their representation in binary) may be an infinitely repeating sequence. Thus it is not possible to perform operations on arbitrary real numbers to exact precision. Instead, arithmetic operations on floating point numbers are approximate, with the level of accuracy determined by factors like how much memory one wants to devote to storing digits, and how much processor time one wants to spend manipulating them. On most computers a python floating point number is accurate to about 1 in 10^15, but this depends on both the architecture and on the operations you perform. That's enough accuracy for many purposes, but there are plenty of situations (for example counting things) when we really want to do things precisely, and we want 1 + 1 to be exactly 2. That's what integers are there for."
