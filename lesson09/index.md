# Lesson 9 - Viz for the web with Sketchfab

Today we'll think about how to share 3D interactive movies on the web.

Make sure you download:
1. [The Planet Files - shapes and surfaces](planetFiles/genericPlanetFiles.zip) and save them to a specific directory.  This includes the library needed to make geometry files from your simulations.
1. You'll want to also download [Meshlab](http://www.meshlab.net/) for testing purposes.

### Also: Sign up for your Sketchfab Account

Don't forget to [sign up right here](https://sketchfab.com) to be able to upload models.
