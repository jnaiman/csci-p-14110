# Lesson 9 - Viz for the web with Sketchfab

Today we'll think about how to share 3D interactive movies on the web.

Make sure you download:
1. <a href="planetFiles/genericPlanetFiles.zip" download>The Planet Files - shapes and surfaces</a> and save them to a specific directory.  This includes the library needed to make geometry files from your simulations.
1. You'll want to also download [Meshlab](http://www.meshlab.net/) for testing purposes.

### Also: Sign up for your Sketchfab Account

Don't forget to [sign up right here](https://sketchfab.com) to be able to upload models.

## More Resources

### For planet models:

 * Think your planet looks different than one of the ones you downloaded?  Check out whats [available on google image search](https://www.google.com/search?q=planet+textures&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjEg-iFjL3jAhWil-AKHcHdBqUQ_AUIESgB&biw=916&bih=693).

### For galaxy models:

 * Check out <a href="extraNotebook_exportingGalaxyData_lesson09.ipynb" download> this notebook to generate a PLY file</a> to upload to Sketchfab.
 * If you want try this out but don't want to spend the time to run the models you can download some saved files from <a href="galaxyFiles/galaxyFiles.zip" download>a simulation right here</a> that includes dark matter and star particles.  Make sure you unzip!
 * Also download <a href="galaxyFiles/solverlibs.py" download>this Python library here</a> to be able to read in this dataset.
 * **movies code** ?
